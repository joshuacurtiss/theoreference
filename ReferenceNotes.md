### Stop Phrases for Paragraphs

Some items have a/b/c/d parts that we want to follow to the end. Also, they
may have a scripture or other item after them. So we look for these phrases in
the following chapter to know we should stop.

Types that this approach applies to:
  - P 1..99
  - Box P 1..99[a..d]
  - Box 1..9
  - Box 1..9 P 1..99[a..d]
  - Presentation 1..9
  
Stopper Expressions:
  - Q 
  - P (#+1)
  - Presentation Intro
  - Build Your Own
  - Subheading
  - Box
  - Art
  - Review

  Other range considerations:
  - `Art 1` will just find all `Art 1*` chapters.
